This is a full stack web project on the Microsoft stack (ASP.NET, C#, MySQL, Visual Studio). It is a web application where you can upload all of your utility bills (water, power, gas) and compare them to nearby users. The site also shows you a lot of useful information to track how your bills are doing month to month by showing timelines, charts, and providing personalized tips on how to reduce your bill based on your living circumstances.
